A logic circuit is a series of logic gates (And, Or, Not) connected with each other.
Is accompanied by a truth table corresponding to every output (True, False) possible.

## Features

2.Easily add, remove, and connect various logic doors

3.Generate a truth table with the click of a button

4.Undo or redo previous actions

5.Save and load an existing logic board

6.Various errors messages to guide the user in making their boards

## Information
-This software was made within the context of an advance software engineering course at l'UQAM.

-Uses the Model-view-controller software pattern.

-Various software design patterns (Factory, Command, Composite, Singleton, Strategy, Observer) 
were implemented in the creation of this application.

-Agile practices were also used throughout development, 
 meetings with the customer (teacher) were held every week in order to validate our progress.

-Java 18 and the latest version of Junit 4.12 are required to run this software.
